# eloquentJs-6-7

I read chapter 6, a couple times, and also read supplemental articles online.  I was not able to complete the exercises on my own, I looked at the answers online and worked backwards to see what was done.  I understand the concepts but don't feel I could implement them on my own yet.  

I worked through and typed out the code from chapter 7 in atom but then realized it could only be run in his sandbox.  Again, I get the concepts from a high level but couldn't implement them on my own and I don't fully understand the complexities behind some of the functions or why they need to be written the way they are.  I understand what they were doing but I couldn't just go make that project on my own.
